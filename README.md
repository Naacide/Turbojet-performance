# Turbojet Engine Performance Calculator

This repository contains a Python library to compute the performance of a turbojet engine with bypass (turbo-fan) using standard thermodynamic assumptions.

## Features

- Compute net and component thrust (primary and secondary flows)
- Specific thrust and TSFC
- Propulsive, kinetic, and thermal power
- Propulsive, thermal, and global efficiency
- Section areas at key stations

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- numpy
- matplotlib

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
